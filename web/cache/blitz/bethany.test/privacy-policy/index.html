<p>Some individuals may not want to provide information to us. The information we request is relevant to providing them with the care and services they need. If the individual chooses not to provide us with some or all of the information we request, we may not be able to provide them with the care and services they require.</p>



<p>We will not collect your Sensitive Information (including Health Information) unless the collection of the information is reasonably necessary for or directly related to one or more of our functions and:</p>











<ul><li>i) you have consented to the collection of this information; or<br /></li><li>ii) the collection of the information is required to be authorised by or under an Australian law or a court/tribunal order; or</li><li>iii) a permitted general situation exists to the collection of the information; or</li><li>iv) a permitted health situation exists in relation to the collection of the information; or</li><li>v) we are a non-profit organisation and:</li><li>A. the information relates to our activities; and</li><li>B. the information relates only to the members of the organisation, or to individuals who have regular contact with us and our activities.</li></ul><h5><strong>6 METHODS OF COLLECTION</strong></h5>

<p>iv) from other health providers or facilities;</p>
<p>v) from family members or significant persons of a client or resident; and</p>
